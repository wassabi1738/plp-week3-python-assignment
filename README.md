# Week 3: Python Functions & Control Flow Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Week 3** assignment for the **PLP Academy** Software Engineering track.  
The task was to write a Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount based on given conditions.

---

## 🛠 Problem Statement
Write a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:
- Takes the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.
- Applies the discount **only if** the discount percentage is **20% or higher**.
- Returns the final price or the original price if the discount condition isn’t met.

The program should:
1. Prompt the user to input the original price.
2. Prompt the user to input the discount percentage.
3. Print the final price with appropriate formatting.

## 🛠 Implementation

The full solution is in [`week3_assignment_discount.py`](./week3_assignment_discount.py).
